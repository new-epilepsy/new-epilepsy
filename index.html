<p class="bolt"> Following the AES 2023 meeting in Orlando, FL, we were strongly motivated to see the neuroimaging community in epilepsy grow and 
    reach new heights of collaboration and leadership. 
    
</br></br>

    This inspiration fuelled the creation of <color-blue> NEW: Neuroimaging of Epilepsy Worldwide</color-blue>; a community-powered platform for trainees, researchers, 
    and clinicians interested in learning, sharing, and building their careers in neuroimaging of epilepsy. 
    
</br></br>

    Our vision for this initiative consists of keeping the community informed of current opportunities in epilepsy research 
    (conferences, job ads, funding) and providing a strong community composed of ECRs and established researchers to 
    facilitate networking, collaboration, and mentorship amongst members.
