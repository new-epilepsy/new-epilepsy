### What is NEW?
Established in 2023, we are a community-powered platform for trainees, researchers, and clinicians interested in learning, sharing, and building their careers in neuroimaging of epilepsy. Our goals are to: 
* Promote and foster collaborations between epilepsy researchers across the world; 
* Put neuroimaging at the forefront of epilepsy research and clinical care; 
* Offer a question-and-answer platform on neuroimaging in epilepsy;
* Organise workshops to contribute to the transfer of knowledge on epilepsy and neuroimaging; and
* Provide opportunities for financial support for researchers and trainees at all stages of their careers
