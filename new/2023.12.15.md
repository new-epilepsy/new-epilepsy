#### We are delighted to introduce the six members of our Executive Team, each bringing unique expertise and passion to promote neuroimaging of epilepsy.

<br/> 

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/nishant.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Nishant Sinha</b> is a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. His research interest is in mapping and understanding epileptic networks. He studies why some patients recover fully after therapy (brain surgery, stimulation, or pharmacotherapy) while others do not. Nishant combines neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and routinely collected patient data to study how the brain networks reorganize due to therapy and makes predictions that complement clinical decision-making.

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/zeke.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Ezequiel Gleichgerrcht</b> is an Assistant professor of Neurology at Emory University and is board-certified in Epilepsy and Clinical Neurophysiology. His clinical interests are intra- and extra-operative functional mapping of brain and dedicates his research efforts to understanding clinical phenotypes in epilepsy through advanced neuroimaging techniques.

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/ab.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Alice Ballerini</b> is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Her research commitment is centered on neuroimaging in epilepsy, with a primary focus in applying advanced neuroimaging methodologies to understand the structural patterns and connectivity networks associated with epileptic conditions, with a special interest in temporal lobe syndromes.

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/drlo.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Lorenzo Caciagli</b> is a Neurology Resident at Bern University Hospital in Switzerland. He has expertise in structural and functional MRI, is faculty on British and International Epilepsy Neuroimaging Courses, and has been serving as member of the ILAE Neuroimaging Task Force since 2020. 
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/jr.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Jessica Royer</b> is clinical neuropsychologist currently pursuing her Ph.D. studies in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University, working with Dr. Boris Bernhardt and Dr. Birgit Frauscher. Her research integrates multiple brain imaging modalities, notably MRI and intracranial EEG, to better understand structural and functional brain organization in healthy individuals and patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/sl.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Sara Larivi√®re</b> is a CIHR Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA. Her research focuses on multiscale connectomics of typical and atypical development, with a specific emphasis on epilepsy. She combines neuroimaging, computational statistics, machine learning, and pipeline development to improve the prediction of clinical and cognitive outcomes following epilepsy surgery, with the goal of improving personalized prognostics, treatment monitoring, and clinical decision-making.
