![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/jr.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <br/> <b>Jessica Royer</b> is clinical neuropsychologist currently pursuing her Ph.D. studies in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience at McGill University, working with Dr. Boris Bernhardt and Dr. Birgit Frauscher. Her research integrates multiple brain imaging modalities, notably MRI and intracranial EEG, to better understand structural and functional brain organization in healthy individuals and patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.

![](https://github.com/new-epilepsy/website-extras/blob/main/team-photos/sl.png?raw=true){: style="float:left; padding-right:33px" width="198"} <b>Sara Larivi√®re</b> is a CIHR Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, MA. Her research focuses on multiscale connectomics of typical and atypical development, with a specific emphasis on epilepsy. She combines neuroimaging, computational statistics, machine learning, and pipeline development to improve the prediction of clinical and cognitive outcomes following epilepsy surgery, with the goal of improving personalized prognostics, treatment monitoring, and clinical decision-making.
