Her research interests include structural and functional imaging in people with refractory epilepsy udergoing surgical evauation. The traslational aim of this is to investigate brain function before epilepsy surgery and predict cognitive outcome following surgery. She runs a general neurology clinic and specialist epilepsy clinics at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and the Chalfont Centre for Epilepsy. She is responsible for in-patients in the Sir William Gowers Assessment and Treatment unit at the Chafont Centre for Epilepsy.
