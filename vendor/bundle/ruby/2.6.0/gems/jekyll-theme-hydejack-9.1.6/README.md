> Your complete presence on the web — A [blog], [portfolio], and [resume].



## A Personal Site That Won't Disappear

**Hydejack** is 100% built on Open Source software, and is Open Source itself, save for parts of the PRO version. The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.

Hydejack is all static sites. _HTML_. All you need is a web server --- any web server --- to have a professional web presence that lasts a lifetime.

**Hydejack** started out as a free blogging theme for Jekyll — and continues to be so.

## Just Markdown
Write all content with Markdown. __Hydejack__ gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.


## Just Markup
**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

The Hydejack blog, as seen by the text browser `w3m`.



## Syntax Highlighting
**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```js
// file: `example.js`
document.querySelector("hy-push-state").addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
  const supportsCodeHighlights = true; //!!
});
```

Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.



## Beautiful Math
They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

![Math example](https://hydejack.com/assets/img/blog/example-content-iii.jpg)

Hydejack uses KaTeX to efficiently render math.




## Build an Audience
The PRO version has built-in support for customizable [Tinyletter] newsletter subscription boxes.

If you are using a different service like MailChimp, you can build a custom newsletter subscription box using [Custom Forms][forms].
